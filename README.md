# PioneerRgbAmpMonitor
A visual monitor using a Adafruit RGB display on a Raspberry Pi. The simple python code allows you to replicate your Pioneer AV Receivers display on a AdaFruit RGB Display.
The project uses your Pioneer receivers telnet port to integrate and read the current status of your device.

The code has been tested using a Pioneer VSX-925. It is likely to work on other 900 range models.

More information, images, parts list and unit tests to be added shortly.
